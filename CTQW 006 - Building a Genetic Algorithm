# Building a genetic algorithm for an Erdos-Renyi network

# Each individual is a specific network topology, for instance
# the output of 'nx.erdos_renyi_graph(34 , 0.25)' is one individual,
# and for each individual we have a set of parameters that represent the edges
# i.e. the connections between the nodes.

# The fitness function is the fidelity between an unknown network
# and our current individual.
# Once the fidelity crosses a certain threshold, then we deem our function evaluated,
# at which stage we will have obtained the optimal solution.

# However,
# we must consider the
